# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *Draws a beautiful beach scene.*

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *Nope*

## REFERENCES *Python turtle documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.textinput (I don't know if this counts as a class material)*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *Program takes 3 user inputs that affect how the image is generated. Please experiment with those to get a better idea of how the pgoram functions! For background: The idea of the program is based on the coin flip exercise we did in chapter 4. On the exercise I originally had the pen change color as it moved to create a more interesting image, which is a similar principle to what was used in this project, with the only differencing being that the color of the pen is determined by its location on-screen to get it to draw a specific image. The program will run continuously until it is stopped.*
