# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *Draws beautiful images from files.*

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *Nope :D*

## REFERENCES *Python turtle documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.textinput (I don't know if this counts as a class material)*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *The program takes a .txt file with data on drawing rectangles and circles. There are a few demo drawings included in the folder so please test all of those out, the default being img_sunset.txt. There's also an img_template.txt that contains an explanation on what the different values in each image mean. Attempting to process a .txt file that isn't formatted properly will either cause an error or cause the image to not render properly. Unfortunately making an easy way to generate the image files wasn't part of the scope of the project, but feel free to open some of the examples to see how they are structured! The program also takes 4 other user inputs that affect how the image is generated. Hitting enter on each input without typing anything will fill in the defaults for each value but the program isn't limited to that. Please experiment with those to get a better idea of how the pgoram functions! :) For background: The idea of the program is based on the coin flip exercise we did in chapter 4. On the exercise I originally had the pen change color as it moved to create a more interesting image, which is a similar principle to what was used in this project. (Didn't reuse the code though ^-^) The program will run continuously until it is stopped.*
